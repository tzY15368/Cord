//
// the service or tester wants to create a Raft server. the ports
// of all the Raft servers (including this one) are in peers[]. this
// server's port is peers[me]. all the servers' peers[] arrays
// have the same order. persister is a place for this server to
// save its persistent state, and also initially holds the most
// recent saved state, if any. applyCh is a channel on which the
// tester or service expects Raft to send ApplyMsg messages.
// Make() must return quickly, so it should start goroutines
// for any long-running work.
//
//
// this is an outline of the API that raft must expose to
// the service (or tester). see comments below for
// each of these functions for more details.
//
// rf = Make(...)
//   create a new Raft server.
// rf.Start(command interface{}) (index, term, isleader)
//   start agreement on a new log entry
// rf.GetState() (term, isLeader)
//   ask a Raft for its current term, and whether it thinks it is leader
// ApplyMsg
//   each time a new entry is committed to the log, each Raft peer
//   should send an ApplyMsg to the service (or tester)
//   in the same server.
//

//
// the service using Raft (e.g. a k/v server) wants to start
// agreement on the next command to be appended to Raft's log. if this
// server isn't the leader, returns false. otherwise start the
// agreement and return immediately. there is no guarantee that this
// command will ever be committed to the Raft log, since the leader
// may fail or lose an election.
//
// the first return value is the index that the command will appear at
// if it's ever committed. the second return value is the current
// term. the third return value is true if this server believes it is
// the leader.
//

//
// example code to send a RequestVote RPC to a server.
// server is the index of the target server in rf.peers[].
// expects RPC arguments in args.
// fills in *reply with RPC reply, so caller should
// pass &reply.
// the types of the args and reply passed to Call() must be
// the same as the types of the arguments declared in the
// handler function (including whether they are pointers).
//
// The labrpc package simulates a lossy network, in which servers
// may be unreachable, and in which requests and replies may be lost.
// Call() sends a request and waits for a reply. If a reply arrives
// within a timeout interval, Call() returns true; otherwise
// Call() returns false. Thus Call() may not return for a while.
// A false return can be caused by a dead server, a live server that
// can't be reached, a lost request, or a lost reply.
//
// Call() is guaranteed to return (perhaps after a delay) *except* if the
// handler function on the server side does not return.  Thus there
// is no need to implement your own timeouts around Call().
//
// look at the comments in ../labrpc/labrpc.go for more details.
//
// if you're having trouble getting RPC to work, check that you've
// capitalized all field names in structs passed over RPC, and
// that the caller passes the address of the reply struct with &, not
// the struct itself.
