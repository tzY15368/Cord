//
// the service or tester wants to create a Raft server. the ports
// of all the Raft servers (including this one) are in peers[]. this
// server's port is peers[me]. all the servers' peers[] arrays
// have the same order. persister is a place for this server to
// save its persistent state, and also initially holds the most
// recent saved state, if any. applyCh is a channel on which the
// tester or service expects Raft to send ApplyMsg messages.
// Make() must return quickly, so it should start goroutines
// for any long-running work.
//
//
// this is an outline of the API that raft must expose to
// the service (or tester). see comments below for
// each of these functions for more details.
//
// rf = Make(...)
//   create a new Raft server.
// rf.Start(command interface{}) (index, term, isleader)
//   start agreement on a new log entry
// rf.GetState() (term, isLeader)
//   ask a Raft for its current term, and whether it thinks it is leader
// ApplyMsg
//   each time a new entry is committed to the log, each Raft peer
//   should send an ApplyMsg to the service (or tester)
//   in the same server.
//

//
// the service using Raft (e.g. a k/v server) wants to start
// agreement on the next command to be appended to Raft's log. if this
// server isn't the leader, returns false. otherwise start the
// agreement and return immediately. there is no guarantee that this
// command will ever be committed to the Raft log, since the leader
// may fail or lose an election.
//
// the first return value is the index that the command will appear at
// if it's ever committed. the second return value is the current
// term. the third return value is true if this server believes it is
// the leader.
